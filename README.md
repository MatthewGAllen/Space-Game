# Space-Game

This is a console based game that has a user controled character and enemies that appear randomly from the top of the game.  The user will be able to move left and right at the bottom of the field and and shoot. Controls are pretty simple; move with the left and right arrows, shoot with the spacebar, and quit using the escape key.
